Decimal and Binary Conversion of IP Addresses

All network professionals need to have a firm grasp of the principles behind IP addressing. This includes understanding how an IP address is associated with a specific network. This is done by using a network address and CIDR to calculate the Network Address, Network Range and Broadcast Address. But the first place we need to start is with a simple understanding of an IP address and it?s conversion to binary and decimal.

An IP address is broken into dotted octet notation. Each octet is expressed as a decimal value from Zero to 255. Since computers start counting from zero this gives us 256 possible values for each octet. Each octet value represents its binary equivalent.

Calculating the decimal value of an IPv4 address is easy. If we were to number the octets from left to right and break them into variables called $octet1, $octet2, $octet3 and $octet4, we can use the following formulas to convert each octet into its decimal value and then add each decimal value to achieve the decimal equivalent for the IP address:

$octet1 x (256^3) = $decimal1

$octet2 x (256^2) = $decimal2

$octet3 x (256) = $decimal3

$octet4 = $decimal4

$decimal1 + $decimal2 + $decimal3 + $decimal4 = $decimal_equivalent

For example, converting IP Address 192.168.1.16 to its decimal equivalent would look like this:

192 x (256^3) = 3221225472

168 x (256^2) = 11010048

1 x 256 = 256

16 = 16

3221225472 + 11010048 + 16 = 3232235792
