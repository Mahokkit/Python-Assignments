Battleship
Each occurrence of the number one in the map indicates a ship location.
The goal of this simplified version of the Battleship game is to sink all ships before running out of missiles.
The goal count down from 30 missiles but you can modify the game to ask how many missiles youâ€™d like to start with
if you wish.
The program should implement all safeguards against user errors such as validating against invalid entries.
